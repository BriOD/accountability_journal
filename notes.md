-User has a journal.
-User creates daily activities (exercising, meditating, reading, deep work)
-Journal has many entries.
-Entries comment daily on individual users activities. completed or not, how long doing activity, notes on that days activity.
-I'm thinking I need a journal that has a name.
-Then entries that belong to a journal. But the entries are just checkmarks on preexisting things that the user has set up.
-So i would want a user to sign up, be asked what daily activities they want to be held accountable for. that would create a users daily_activities.
-A daily_activity model would have a name, boolean of true or false for that day, and a notes
-How would you then regenerate a individual users daily_activities.
-Maybe it would just be part of the user model...
